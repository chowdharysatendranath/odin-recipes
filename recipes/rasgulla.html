    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Rasgulla is a traditional sweet that is usually served at the end of a
      meal, like many other Indian milk-based desserts. It is prepared from
      chhena paneer dumplings and semolina dough, cooked together in a sugary
      syrup. The origin of rasgulla is the subject of a heated debate, with West
      Bengal and Odisha both claiming to be the birthplace of the dessert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bengalis claim that rasgulla was the byproduct of many culinary
      experiments in the state, while the people of Odisha claim that it was
      traditionally offered to Lord Jagannath for centuries. However, most food
      historians agree that the truth is somewhere in between.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years, both varieties got their own GI status in order to
      differentiate between the two.
